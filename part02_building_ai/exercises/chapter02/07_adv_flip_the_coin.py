#Write a program that generates 10000 random zeros and ones where the probability of one is p1 and the probability of zero is 1-p1 (hint: np.random.choice([0,1], p=[1-p1, p1], size=10000)), counts the number of occurrences of 5 consecutive ones ("11111") in the sequence, and outputs this number as a return value. Check that for p1 = 2/3, the count is close to 10000 x (2/3)^5 â‰ˆ 1316.9. 

import numpy as np

def generate(p1):
    # change this so that it generates 10000 random zeros and ones
    # where the probability of one is p1
    seq = np.random.choice([0,1], p=[1-p1, p1], size=10000)
    return seq

def count(seq):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(seq) - 4):  # Adjusted range to account for 5 consecutive elements
        if np.all(seq[i:i+5] == 1):  # Changed comparison to check for all ones
            count += 1
    return count
