    Let the elevation at each point on the mountain be stored in array h of size 100. The elevation at the leftmost point is thus stored in h[0] and the elevation at the rightmost point is stored in h[99].

     The following program starts at a random position and keeps going to the right until Venla can no longer go up. To make it easier to avoid falling off the map at the boundaries, we set both h[0] and h[100] equal to zero which is lower than any of the values in between.

    You can see the result in the above chart where the starting point is marked with a small green box and the point where Venla stops is marked with a small red triangle. This works fine as long as the summit is to her right, but maybe it is to the left?

    Edit the program so that Venla doesn't stop climbing if she can go up either by moving left or right. If both ways go up, either one is good. To check how your climbing algorithm works in action, you can plot the results of your hill climbing using the Plot button. The summit will be marked with a blue triangle.
