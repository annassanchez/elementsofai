# Chapter01: Getting started with AI

## I. Why AI matters

<h3>In this course, we're going to take you on a journey towards your first implementable AI idea and give you the tools to make it a reality. The path begins by looking into the algorithms that make artificial intelligence methods possible. But before we start, we wanted to take a brief moment to discuss why AI matters in the first place.</h3>

In a word, relevance. Artificial intelligence, or at leas "narrow AI" (AI that handles only one task), is already a part of our dailly lives. When we search online, use our smartphone to take and edit a picture, ask Siri or Alexa for a recommendation, or use GPS navigation, we're relying on AI methods. In practice this means we're already surrounded by AI, and this influence only looks set to grow.

As you will find in this course, we think this influence is a good thing - so lon as we're smart about it. After all, AI is simply a collection of methods for solving problems. We think that AI is too important to leace just to tech experts. That's why our goal is to empower as many people as possible to be part og creating meaningful AI solutions to real-world problems. Building AI is for anyone who wants to improve their AI-related vocabulary and skills, including non-programmers and people who can program in Python. By taking the course, you'll learn more about what makes different AI methods possible and where and how these methods can be applied in real life - helping you to communicate about AI and take part in AI-related projects. 

For some of you, this course will also be the first step towards actually being able to program these methods. From here, you'll be able to go to more advanced courses that really delve into the programming. By finishing this course, you'll be able to start firmulating a realistic, useful and implementable AI idea - which can become your own project that you develop as far as you want.

### What AI looks like in real life

Here are just a few examples of where you can find AI methods at work. These are all real-life cases that we will look at in more detail in later chapters:

| ![](images/1_1.svg) | **<h4>Content recommendation</h4>** All of us are familiar with content recommendation systems (think Netflix or YouTube). But as it turns out, commonly used recommendation algorithms are good for example at recommending popular shows (like drama) while downplaying other areas like educational or scientific content. But this can be changed, increading people's exposure to broader types content. |
| ![](images/1_2.svg)  | **<h4>Online shopping</h4>**  So much choice, so little time. But how do you make browsing tens of thousands of items convenient, expecially on a mobile phone? Machine learning methods can recommend products based on the purchase behavior of an individual user as well as other customers who purchased similar products.|
| ![](images/1_3.svg)  | **<h4>Online support</h4>** Nearly half of social media users have encountered online bullying or harassment online. Machine learning methods based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to provide scalable legal and psychological first aid online |
| ![](images/1_4.svg) | **<h4>Resources mapping</h4>** What kind of critical infraestructure (like schools) exists in your country? In a lot of places around the world, the answer is "not sure". But having an accurate and comprehensive map of infraestructure is a key tool for measuring and improving quality. Heuran networks can be trained to identify features from looking at high-resolution satellite images in order to identify buildings and create accurate maps.  |
| ![](images/1_5.svg) | **<h4>Waste sorting</h4>** Reduce, reuse, recycle - we're all familiar with the mantra, and most of us dutifully sort our waste. But what happens after that? The fact is a lot of what we "recycle" still ends up in a landfill or is incinerated. But using neural networks can enable robots to sort waste and improve recycling rates. |
| ![](images/1_6.svg) | **<h4>Your AI idea</h4>** For learning purposes, this is probably the most important example of real-life AI in this course, simply because it's yours. The optional project in Chapter 5 is the endpoint of your Elements of AI journey and the final stepping stone after which you'll be able to present your idea to the wider AI community. |

><h3>Working with AI in real life</h3>
>
>People can encounter and use AI in their work in many different ways. Here are three common examples:
>
>- You can work as a professiona who has a good understanding of AI methods and the ability to ideate realistic solutions that involve an AI component. The ability to combine an understanding of AI with knowledge from other fields can lead to valuable results, even if you're not writing the code yourself.
>
>- Those who are more interested in the infrastructure behind what makes AI systems tick can work, for instance, as Data Engineers. A Data Engineer makes sure that data flows where it is neede and is of the right type and quality for specific AI solutions. It's crucial with real-life, large-scale, production-ready AI systems to get the supporting infrastructure right so as to avoid the so called "garbage in, garbage out" problem
>
>- THose who have a dep understanding of AI algorithms can apply this methods to real-life problems with job titles such as AI Developer, AI Engineer, or Data Scientist. To excel in this area, you need to have rpoven track record in applyting AI to defferent types of problems. In addition to the technical skills, you should apply AI in the first place, and when not.
>
>The world seems to be full of people who claim to be AI evangelists but what modern companies are looking for is people who can make things happen and who actually understand what AI is and what it isn't capable of - and that's exactly whar this courtse can help with.

>If you are aiming fot a career in Data Science, you may wish to consider in applying, for instance, to the [University of Helsinki's Master Programme in Data Science](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/admissions/degree-programmes/data-science-masters-programme)
