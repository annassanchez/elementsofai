# Chapter 01: what is AI?
## I. How should we define AI?
### In our very first section, we'll become familiar qith the concept of AI by looking intro it's definition and some examples.
As you have probably noticed, AI is currently a "hot topic": media coverage and public discussion about AI is almost impossible to avoid. However, you may also have noticed that AI means different things to different people. For some, AI is about artificial life-forms that can surpass human intelligence, and for others, almost any data processing technology can be called AI.
To set the scene, so to speak, we'll discuss what AI is, how it can be defined, and what other fields or technologies are closely related. Before we do so, however, we'll highlight three applications of AI that illustrate different aspects of AI. We'll return to each of them throughout the course to deepen our understanding.

### Aplication 01. Self-driving cars
Self-driving cars require a combination of AI techniques of many kinds: seach and planning to find the most convenient route from A to B, computer vision to identify obstacles, and decision making under uncertainty to cope with the complex and dynamic enviroment. Each of these must work with almost flawless precision in order to avoid accidents.
The same technologies are also used in other autonomous systems such as delivery robots, flying drones, and autonomous ships.
**Implications:** road safety should eventually improe as the reliability of the systems syroassses human level. The efficiency of logistics chains when moving goods should improve. Humans move into a supervisory role, keeping an eye on what's going on while machines take care of the driving. Since transportation is such cructial element in our daily life, it is likely that there are also some implications that we haven't even thought about yet.
